description: After the success of Zane Grey's first novel, Betty Zane, first published
  in 1903, Grey gave up his dental practice in New York City to concentrate on writing
  the westerns that would make him as rich and famous as a movie star. But ancestral
  pride, not money, was the impetus for Betty Zane. It was based on family stories
  about his great-grandfather, Colonel Ebenezer Zane, who had defended Fort Henry
  during the American Revolution. West Virginians remember that the colonel's young
  daughter, Betty, saved the fort during a British-Indian onslaught in 1782 - the
  last battle of the Revolutionary War. Her act of courage gives focus to this rousing
  novel, replete with other historical figures like the ferocious Lewis Wetzel, the
  notorious renegade Simon Girty, and the Seneca chief Cornplanter. Betty Zane, the
  headstrong heroine moves in an authentic atmosphere of danger and romance.
